The Aroon indicator is a technical indicator that is used to identify trend changes in the price of an asset, as well as the strength of that trend. In essence, the indicator measures the time between highs and the time between lows over a time period. The idea is that strong uptrends will regularly see new highs, and strong downtrends will regularly see new lows. The indicator signals when this is happening, and when it isn't.

How to Calculate the Aroon Indicator

The Aroon calculation requires the tracking of the high and low prices, typically over 25 periods.
Track the highs and lows for the last 25 periods on an asset.
Note the number of periods since the last high and low.
Plug these numbers into the Up and Down Aroon formulas.
